            <h2>General Concepts</h2>
            <h4>Turns</h4>
            <p>
                Battles (scenarios) last a certain number of turns and the current turn number and maximum turns is
                shown in he top left corner of the screen.
                In each turn you, your allies, and your opponents are given a chance to move units, attack enemy
                units, resupply units, and
                so on. When you finished all your orders you can press the End Turn button <span
                    class="icon_round inline">t</span>
                from the right side of the screen.
            </p>
            <h4>Combat</h4>
            <p>
                The attack reticule appears when you pass the mouse pointer over an enemy within the firing range of
                your selected unit or for touch enabled devices automatically for all units in attack range.
                This reticule shows the expected losses in strength points for both sides; your projected
                casualties are listed below your flag, and your enemies losses are listed under the flag of that
                unit's country.
                Keep in mind that these are estimated losses; although based on the relative attack and defense
                values, terrain, and experience modifiers, they may not be the same in actual battle! In any
                conflict there
                is a random factor and besides that, the estimated values don't take in account all the factors.
                It's up to you
                to decide the actual results.
                If you decide to attack, click when the attack reticule is over the enemy unit.
                As battle ensues, unit losses are indicated on the unit strength plaques, and loses are displayed by
                a popping number over each unit.
                A unit may move and attack, or attack then move, with the exception of artillery,
                air defense, or anti-tank units which cannot attack after moving (with exception of self-propelled
                units).
            </p>

            <h4>Core and Auxiliary Units</h4>
            <p>
                In campaign play, your forces for a battle may contain both core and auxiliary units. Core units are
                the heart of your army, units which you deploy for every battle, and go with you to each new
                scenario.
                However, you may also receive or be put in command of auxiliaries, units which are given to you for
                the duration of a
                particular battle scenario, to aid you in your mission. Auxiliaries do not continue to the next
                battle with the rest of your
                core army.
            </p>

            <h4>Zone of control</h4>
            <p>
                A unit exerts a zone of control over the six hexes around it. Surface unit's zones of control affect
                only surface units and air unit's zones of control affect only air units. When you move a unit into
                the zone of
                control of an enemy unit, your unit's movement is stopped and it must either attack or end its turn,
                unless it is
                a recon unit.
                If your unit was ordered to move to a point which takes it through a hex occupied by a previously
                hidden enemy unit, your unit is <mark>surprised</mark> by the enemy unit, and your unit's turn ends
                after combat is
                resolved.
            </p>
            <h4>Prestige</h4>
            <p>
                Prestige is the game currency, allowing purchasing of new unis, upgrading units, unit resupply and
                reinforcement.
                Prestige can be gained by: capturing objectives, wining scenarios, and depending on difficulty and
                scenario, it can be
                awarded each turn by an amount set in the scenario.
            </p>
            <h4>Victory Conditions</h4>
            <p>
                Battles are won by taking or holding some or all of the Victory Objective hexes, which are
                represented by hexes with gold-bordered flags on the Battlefield and Strategic Map. Capturing towns,
                supply points, ports, and airfields that are not Victory Objectives gains you prestige points, but
                does not
                affect the victory conditions, so you should always focus on capturing the objectives you have been
                ordered to take.
                Destroying all enemy units will also trigger a victory.
                Depending on how fast you capture all objectives victories can be brilliant, normal or tactical and
                each give a certain amount of prestige points. Brillian victories give the most prestige points and
                you are also rewarded with a <ins>prototype</ins> unit for your core army in the next scenario.
                If you don't meet your objectives in the maximum number of turns the battle is lost and depending on
                campaign path flow it can also result in ending the campaign. Some scenarios can only be "won" by
                playing the game until
                last turn, usually this is noted in the briefing at the start of the scenario.

            <p> A unit starts with 10 strength points. A unit current strength is given on the strength
                tag,
                below the unit icon on the Battlefield. Casualties taken in battle are represented by a loss of strength
                points, and a unit reduced to zero strength points is destroyed. Each strength point
                makes an individual attack on the enemy using the unit attack and defense values. The number of
                strength points used for attack is also halved by rain or snow for ground troops and by overcast
                weather for air units (air units may not attack in rain or snow). The units are considered to be
                regiments/brigades,
                with the exception of reconnaissance units (and perhaps some anti-aircraft units), which would remain
                battalions.

                without fuel
                and in need of resupply. With a clear terrain or road every movement consumes 1 point of fuel. Other
                terrain and weather types
                will increase fuel consumption.

            </div>

            <p> How many attacks a unit can perform. Each attack uses 1 ammo. A unit without ammo will
                get
                increased casualties
                when attacked. Artillery without ammo cannot perform supporting fire.

            <p> The distance in hexes that the unit can attack an enemy unit. Usually artillery units
                have
                a range bigger than
                1 but powerfull tank, anti-tank, air defence and even infantry can have a range of 2.

            <p> The range in hexes that a unit can move in 1 turn. Each unit has a movement point
                allowance
                per turn that is spent as it moves.
                The movement point cost of each hex depends on the terrain in the hex, weather conditions, and the
                unit
                movement type.

                <h4>Experience</h4>
            </div>

            <p> Each time a unit takes part in combat it gains experience, and the more successful it is
                in
                combat, the
                more experience points it gains. The maximum experience level a unit can achieve is 10.
                When two units fight, their relative experience levels affect combat, and help determine relative
                casualties. Experience also determines overstrength size, reduces the risk of rugged defense, and
                modifies initiative. Units with two or three experience levels should be considered veteran troops
                and
                those with four or five levels elite troops. Veteran units sustain fewer casualties and inflict more
                casualties than a less experienced unit. Units
                gain experience by fighting and gain the most by destroying, or forcing into retreat, more
                experienced
                enemy units and units with better equipment. Making veteran and elite units overstrength is valuable
                because they are better able to withstand and
                inflict casualties in combat.

                <h4>Entrenchment</h4>

            <p> Units that have not moved are assumed to dig in each turn even if they attack, resupply,
                and so on.
                Each turn the unit does not move, it entrenches further. If a unit moves out of the hex, it loses
                all
                its
                entrenchment levels,
                All terrain types have a base entrenchment level from zero to three, which ground units in that hex
                with
                lower entrenchment levels automatically obtain at the end of their turn. This number is not added to
                the unit entrenchment level; it replaces it. Base entrenchment levels are: three for cities, two for
                forests, bocage (intertwined hedgerows), and mountains, one for rough terrain and hills, and zero
                for
                everything else. Units can entrench up to a maximum of five levels above the base entrenchment level
                for the terrain.
                Entrenchment levels are reduced by attacks or bombardment of entrenched ground units. Each attack,
                whether it is successful or not, reduces the unit entrenchment level by one level. Repeated attacks
                in
                a single turn can even reduce the entrenchment level below the base level for the terrain, thus
                facilitating further attacks during the same turn. A proven way to attack a strongly entrenched unit
                is
                with a combination of aerial and artillery preparatory bombardment, followed by ground attacks by
                one
                or more units. Engineer units, with the exception of bridge engineers, ignore entrenchment, making
                them valuable units during this type of assault.

                <h4>Combat initiative</h4>
            </div>

            <p> Initiative is an estimate of a unit ability to react quickly in combat. Initiative is
                determined by the equipment used in battle, the terrain upon which the battle takes place, and the
                experience of the units. It is also adjusted by a random factor, to help simulate the uncertainty of
                battle. The higher the unit initiative, the better, since the unit with the higher initiative takes
                reduced damage. If a tactical surprise or rugged defense occurs, the attacker initiative is zero.

            <p> The distance, in hexes, at which a unit becomes aware of the general location of enemy
                units. Note that there are no terrain restrictions on spotting range; for example, a mountain
                hex does not block spotting beyond it, however, spotting range may be reduced by bad weather.
                Once a hex is spotted during a player turn, it remains sighted for the entire turn. Any time a
                friendly
                unit moves and does not cancel its move, it surveys all hexes within its spotting range. Enemy units
                within your unit spotting range are automatically revealed.

                ground units suffer the handicap of using their close defense values. Infantry do not retain this

            <h2>Terrain</h2>
            <p>
                Careful analysis of terrain is vital to a well conceived and executed battle strategy. Terrain
                affects
                movement, since some types of ground are more difficult to negotiate than others. Also, some types
                of
                terrain
                provide greater base entrenchment, making those areas more defensible, and more difficult to clear
                of
                enemy
                defenders.
                <br>
                In difficult terrain, such as cities and mountains, defending and attacking infantry shoot against
                the
                close defense number of the enemy unit, usually placing the non-infantry unit at a severe
                disadvantage. The exception to this being that infantry may attack another unit that succeeds in
                putting up a rugged defense, in which case the attacker shoots at the defenders ground defense
                value. Infantry and artillery can be highly effective when defending from difficult terrain,
                particularly
                against larger vehicles, such as tanks, which have difficulty bringing their full power to bear.
                Conversely, tank and self-propelled anti-tank units, which have difficulty in cities and forests,
                can be
                dominant in clear terrain, where defending infantry and artillery need to be entrenched to survive
                an
                armoured attack.
                <br>
                Rivers are a terrain type that deserves special mention. Entering a river hex ends a ground unit's
                movement, except when the river is frozen. It may exit the river hex normally the following turn.
                Dismounted bridging engineers may serve as bridges, eliminating this penalty for the hexes engineers
                occupy. The bridging engineers can also bridge rivers where there is no ford. When a bridging
                engineer unit moves into a river hex, a pontoon bridge appears. Friendly units may then move over
                the
                bridge icon. Note: Some rivers are too wide to cross with bridging engineers.
                <br>
                The table below shows, for each type of terrain, how fast your unit entrenches, combat initiative and
                movement cost.
                For movement costs ‚óè means unit can enter but will consume all movements points and ‚ñ† means an unit
                cannot enter/pass that terrain at all.
