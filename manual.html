                On this reticule are given the expected loss in strength points for both sides; your projected
                casualties are listed below your flag, and your enemies losses are listed under the flag of that unit's
                country.
                Keep in mind that these are estimated losses; although based on the relative attack and defense values,
                terrain, and experience modifiers, they may not be the same in actual battle! In any conflict there is a
                random
                factor and besides that the estimated values don't take in account all the factors. It's up to you to
                decide the actual results.
                If you decide to attack, click when the attack reticule is over the enemy unit.
                As battle ensues, unit losses are indicated on the unit strength plaques, and loses are displayed by a
                popping number over each unit.
                A unit may move and attack, or attack then move, with the exception of artillery,
                air defense, or anti-tank units which cannot attack after moving (with exception of self-propelled
                units).

            <div class="subtitle">Core and Auxiliary Units</div>
            <div class="text">
                In campaign play, your forces for a battle may contain both core and auxiliary units. Core units are the
                heart
                of your army, units which you deploy for every battle, and go with you to each new scenario. However,
                you may also
                receive or be put in command of auxiliaries, units which are given to you for the duration of a
                particular conflict,
                to aid you in your mission. Auxiliaries do not continue to the next battle with the rest of your army.

            <div class="subtitle"> Zone of control</div>
            <div class="text">
                A unit exerts a zone of control over the six hexes around it. Surface unit's zones of control affect
                only surface
                units and air unit's zones of control affect only air units. When you move a unit into the zone of
                control of an
                enemy unit, your unit's movement is stopped and it must either attack or end its turn, unless it is a
                recon unit.
                If your unit was ordered to move to a point which takes it through a hex occupied by a previously hidden
                enemy unit, your unit is surprised by the enemy unit, and your unit's turn ends after combat is
                resolved.
            </div>
            <div class="subtitle">Victory Conditions</div>
            <div class="text">
                Battles are won by taking or holding some or all of the Victory Objective hexes, which are represented
                by hexes with gold-bordered flags on the Battlefield and Strategic Map. Capturing towns, supply
                points, ports, and airfields that are not Victory Objectives gains you prestige points, but does not
                affect
                the victory conditions, so you should always focus on capturing the objectives you have been ordered
                to take.
                Destroying all enemy units will also trigger a victory.
                Depending on how fast you capture all objectives victories can be brilliant, normal or tactical and each
                give
                a certain amount of prestige points. Brillian victories give the most prestige points and you are also
                rewarded
                with a prototype unit for your core army in the next scenario.
                If you don't meet your objectives in the maximum number of turns the battle is lost and depending on
                campaign
                path flow it can also result in ending the campaign.

                Some scenarios can only be "won" by playing the game until last turn, usually this is noted in the
                briefing at the start of the scenario.

                <div class="text"> Each time a unit takes part in combat it gains experience, and the more successful it
                    is in
                    combat, the
                    more experience points it gains. The maximum experience level a unit can achieve is 10.
                    When two units fight, their relative experience levels affect combat, and help determine relative
                    casualties. Experience also determines overstrength size, reduces the risk of rugged defense, and
                    modifies initiative. Units with two or three experience levels should be considered veteran troops
                    and
                    those with four or five levels elite troops. Veteran units sustain fewer casualties and inflict more
                    casualties than a less experienced unit. Units
                    gain experience by fighting and gain the most by destroying, or forcing into retreat, more
                    experienced
                    enemy units and units with better equipment. Making veteran and elite units overstrength is valuable
                    because they are better able to withstand and
                    inflict casualties in combat.

                    resupply,
                    and so on.
                    Each turn the unit does not move, it entrenches further. If a unit moves out of the hex, it loses
                    all its
                    entrenchment levels,
                    All terrain types have a base entrenchment level from zero to three, which ground units in that hex
                    with
                    lower entrenchment levels automatically obtain at the end of their turn. This number is not added to
                    the unit entrenchment level; it replaces it. Base entrenchment levels are: three for cities, two for
                    forests, bocage (intertwined hedgerows), and mountains, one for rough terrain and hills, and zero
                    for
                    everything else. Units can entrench up to a maximum of five levels above the base entrenchment level
                    for the terrain.
                    Entrenchment levels are reduced by attacks or bombardment of entrenched ground units. Each attack,
                    whether it is successful or not, reduces the unit entrenchment level by one level. Repeated attacks
                    in
                    a single turn can even reduce the entrenchment level below the base level for the terrain, thus
                    facilitating further attacks during the same turn. A proven way to attack a strongly entrenched unit
                    is
                    with a combination of aerial and artillery preparatory bombardment, followed by ground attacks by
                    one
                    or more units. Engineer units, with the exception of bridge engineers, ignore entrenchment, making
                    them valuable units during this type of assault.

                    battle. The higher the unit initiative, the better, since the unit with the higher initiative takes
                    reduced damage. If a tactical surprise or rugged defense occurs, the attacker initiative is zero.
